//While compiling and simulating the Ticket Machine FSM with the testbench, the simulator generated errors such as:

Undefined identifier State

Incorrect state display

State not accessible in testbench

This occurred because State and NextState were declared inside the package instead of inside the module.
problem 1:                                                                                                          package definitions;
