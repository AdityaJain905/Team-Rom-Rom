The given testbench was giving the output exactly one clock cycle ahead. This issue has been resolved, the passed waveform confirms that the traffic light controller FSM is functioning correctly. When rst_n is asserted low, the system properly resets to the RED state (red=1, yellow=0, green=0), verifying correct asynchronous reset behavior. After reset is released and enable is set high, the FSM transitions synchronously on each positive clock edge in the correct sequence: RED → GREEN → YELLOW → RED, with each state lasting exactly one clock cycle. The outputs change in alignment with the clock, indicating proper flip-flop-based state implementation and Moore machine behavior, with no one-cycle offset issues. The testbench counters show test_count = 4, pass_count = 4, and fail_count = 0, confirming that all state transitions and output checks passed successfully.
